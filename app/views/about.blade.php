<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Our team’s developing one of the 8 ideas selected to represent the UK – Clothesline, what we’re calling a ‘brand discovery website’</p>
<p>Here’s the lowdown –</p>
<ol>
<li>People want to discover new brands. When you’re looking for new ideas, or new themes for your wardrobe, you want to find all the cool stuff that fits your taste.</li>
<li>But how do you find new brands online?</li>
<li>Right now, people engage with brands by going to Google and typing in the name (Zara, Topshop etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The solution: Create a web platform to recommend brands based on your history of engagement with them, ala Netflix.</p>

<ol>
<li>You log in.</li>
<li>You search for stuff you’re interested in (luxury products, shoes, etc.)</li>
<li>Our patented algorithms pick out brands based on what you’ve clicked on / favourited in the past, and suggest them to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bam. Discovery. And now you’ve got a new store to hit when you head down the high street. Or just buy stuff online.</p>

<p>It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Blah blah</p>
